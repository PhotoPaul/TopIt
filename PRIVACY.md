This Privacy Policy explains how **TopIt for Gmail** ("the Extension") handles your information. Your privacy is paramount, and the extension is designed to be as private and secure as possible.

## 1. No Data Collection
**TopIt for Gmail does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.** 

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other identifying information.
- **No Email Data:** The extension does not read, store, or analyze the content of your emails.
- **No Tracking:** We do not use cookies, analytics, trackers, or any other form of monitoring to see how you use the extension.

## 2. Permissions and Usage

    - Inject the "Send to Top" button into the Gmail user interface.
    - Automate the native Gmail "Snooze" feature to resurface emails after 1 minute.
- **Local Execution:** All processing occurs locally within your web browser. No data ever leaves your device.

## 3. Third-Party Services
TopIt for Gmail does not communicate with any external servers. There are no third-party advertisements, analytics providers, or data brokers integrated into the extension.

Transparency is key to trust. TopIt for Gmail is an open-source project. You are encouraged to review the code yourself on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/) (replace with actual URL if available) to verify our privacy claims.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Because the extension does not collect any contact information, we recommend checking the repository or the Chrome Web Store listing for updates.
